Carp-REPL 0.07

Carp::REPL is a drop-in module for getting a REPL (read-eval-print-loop)
which helps you in examining the state of the world when things blew up.
Essentially, you just add -MCarp::REPL to your script's invocation. One
advantage of using Carp::REPL over Devel::REPL is the lexical variables are
made available, as well as stack manipulation commands.

MAJOR CHANGES
    0.07: sub arguments stuffed into $_a
    0.06: proper aliases so you can influence the environment
    0.05: :bt to redisplay stack trace, :q to quit
    0.03: :up and :down for traversing the call stack
    0.01: first version
