Carp-REPL 0.04

Carp::REPL is a drop-in module for getting a REPL (read-eval-print-loop)
which helps you in examining the state of the world when things blew up.
Essentially, you just add -MCarp::REPL to your script's invocation. One
advantage of using Carp::REPL over Devel::REPL is the lexical variables are
made available, as well as stack manipulation commands.
