Carp-REPL

Carp::REPL is a drop-in module for getting a REPL (read-eval-print-loop)
which helps you in examining the state of the world when things blew up.
Essentially, you just add -MCarp::REPL to your script's invocation. While
you certainly can "use Carp::REPL" it's probably not the right thing to do.
If you just need a REPL, check out Devel::REPL which is what this module
uses.
